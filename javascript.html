<h2>java practice</h2>

<p>This is javascript and its very confusing to me</p>

<p id="p1"></p>
<p id="p2"></p>

<script>
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
document.getElementById("p1").innerHTML = //writing out the math of 5 + 6 = 11
"x + y =z, z=: " +z; //I'm assuming +z; just adds the value of whatever z is at the time as text

var vegetation = ["Tree","Plant","Grass","Flower"]; //array called vegetation
document.getElementById("p2").innerHTML = vegetation //calls the array "vegetation" into the HTML i think
</script>

<h2>this is a Javascript function</h2>
